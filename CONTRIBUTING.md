# Contributing to Subscription Licensing System Specification

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This repository contains the design specification for a subscription licensing system with certificate authentication.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors, regardless of background or identity.

### Our Standards

**Positive behavior includes:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

## About This Repository

This repository contains the **design specification** for a subscription licensing system. It does not contain implementation code. The specification documents:

- System architecture and security model
- Certificate and license workflows
- API endpoint specifications
- Database schema designs
- Implementation guidelines

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Found a problem with the specification? Please open an issue:

**Include:**
- Which section of the spec has the issue
- Description of the problem (ambiguity, error, missing information)
- Suggested correction or clarification
- Impact on implementation (if applicable)

**Examples of valid issues:**
- "Section 8.2: PHP code example has syntax error"
- "Section 5.1: Device ID generation unclear for Android"
- "Section 3: Security model doesn't address certificate pinning"
- "Database schema missing index on frequently-queried column"

### Suggesting Improvements

Enhancement suggestions for the specification are welcome:

**Include:**
- Clear description of the proposed addition/change
- Rationale (why it improves the system)
- Security implications (if any)
- Implementation complexity considerations
- Alternative approaches considered

**Examples:**
- "Add hardware attestation flow to certificate enrollment"
- "Specify rate limiting for API endpoints"
- "Add sequence diagram for error recovery scenarios"
- "Include load balancing considerations for multi-server deployments"

### Security Considerations

If you've identified a security flaw in the **design specification**:

**For minor issues**: Open a GitHub issue
**For serious vulnerabilities**: Email alan@whitemail.net

Include:
- Description of the security concern
- Potential attack vector
- Suggested mitigation
- References to relevant security standards (if applicable)

### Documentation Improvements

Help make the specification clearer:

- Fix typos and grammar
- Add clarifying examples
- Improve diagrams
- Add cross-references between sections
- Clarify ambiguous descriptions

## Contribution Process

### Small Changes (Typos, Grammar, Minor Clarifications)

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/typo-section-8`
3. Make your changes to `spec.md` or `README.md`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "Fix typo in certificate enrollment section"`
5. Push and open a Pull Request

### Larger Changes (New Sections, Architectural Changes)

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the proposed change
2. Wait for feedback from maintainers
3. Once approved, follow the same fork/branch/PR process
4. Include detailed explanation in PR description

## Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Description should include:**
- Summary of changes
- Motivation and context
- Related issue number (if applicable)
- Impact on other sections of the spec
- Any breaking changes to the design

**Before submitting:**
- Ensure markdown formatting is correct
- Check that all links work
- Verify code examples are syntactically correct
- Update table of contents if you added/removed sections
- Run a spell check

### Commit Message Format

```
[Section] Brief description

Detailed explanation if needed.

Fixes #123
```

**Examples:**
```
[Section 4.1] Clarify certificate enrollment token validation

Added details about token expiration handling and
database transaction requirements.

Fixes #45
```

```
[Section 10] Add DDoS protection considerations

Includes rate limiting recommendations for all
public-facing endpoints.
```

## Specification Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise technical language
- Define acronyms on first use
- Use active voice where possible
- Be specific rather than vague
- Include "why" along with "what" and "how"

### Code Examples

- Use realistic, working examples
- Include error handling where relevant
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Specify language/framework versions where relevant
- Ensure examples align with described architecture

### Diagrams

- Use Mermaid syntax for sequence diagrams and flowcharts
- Keep diagrams focused on one concept
- Use consistent terminology across diagrams
- Include legend if using non-standard symbols

### Database Schema

- Use standard SQL syntax
- Include comments for complex relationships
- Specify indexes explicitly
- Document any denormalization decisions

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks**: Markdown linting, link validation
2. **Maintainer review**: Technical accuracy, clarity, completeness
3. **Discussion**: Back-and-forth on complex changes
4. **Approval**: Once consensus reached
5. **Merge**: Maintainer merges PR

## Areas for Contribution

**Good first contributions:**
- Fix typos and grammar
- Add clarifying examples
- Improve existing diagrams
- Add cross-references

**More involved contributions:**
- Add missing error scenarios
- Expand platform-specific sections
- Add security threat analysis

## Implementation Projects

If you implement this specification in code:

1. **Let us know!** Open an issue to share your implementation
2. Consider contributing implementation notes back to this spec
3. Share lessons learned that could improve the design
4. Link to your implementation repository

We'd love to know about:
- Server implementations (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.)
