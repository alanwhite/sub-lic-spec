## 3. LICENSE VALIDATION AND NETWORK CONNECTIVITY

### 3.1 Certificate-Based Authentication
The Software uses digital certificates issued by Our private Certificate Authority to verify your license. Upon initial setup, you will receive a client certificate that uniquely identifies your licensed installation.

### 3.2 Network Connections
**IMPORTANT: The Software requires periodic network connections to Our license servers for the following purposes:**

a) **Initial Activation**: During first-time setup, the Software will connect to Our servers to:
   - Validate your enrollment token
   - Obtain your client certificate
   - Receive your initial license token

b) **License Renewal**: The Software will automatically connect to Our servers:
   - Approximately [7] days before your subscription expires
   - To verify your subscription payment status
   - To renew your license token if payment is current
   - At intervals during any grace period

c) **Certificate Operations**: The Software may connect to Our servers to:
   - Renew expiring certificates (approximately 30 days before expiration)
   - Check certificate revocation status
   - Validate license integrity

d) **License Migration**: When transferring your license to a new device, the Software will connect to Our servers to:
   - Validate the migration request
   - Deactivate the license on the old device
   - Activate the license on the new device

### 3.3 Offline Operation
The Software is designed to operate offline for the duration of your active subscription period. However, periodic network connectivity is required for license renewal and certificate management. Extended offline use beyond your subscription expiration date will result in reduced or disabled functionality.

### 3.4 Grace Period
If your subscription payment fails or expires, the Software will continue to function for a limited grace period:
- **Monthly subscriptions**: [5] days
- **Annual subscriptions**: [14] days

During the grace period, the Software will attempt to connect to Our servers daily to check for subscription renewal.

### 3.5 Network Requirements
The Software requires:
- HTTPS connectivity to [license-server.yourdomain.com] on ports 443 and 8443
- Ability to validate SSL/TLS certificates
- No proxy authentication (or proper proxy configuration)

### 3.6 Firewall Considerations
If you use a firewall, you must allow outbound HTTPS connections to Our license servers. Blocking these connections will prevent license validation and may result in loss of functionality.
