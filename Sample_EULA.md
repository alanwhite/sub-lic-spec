---

## 3. NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AND LICENSE VALIDATION

### 3.1 Free Tier - No Network Requirement
**The Free Tier operates entirely offline and does NOT require:**
- Account creation
- Network connectivity to Our servers
- Certificate authentication
- License validation

The Free Tier does not transmit any information to Our servers during normal operation.

### 3.2 Premium Tier - Certificate-Based Authentication
**Premium Tier features use digital certificates issued by Our private Certificate Authority to verify your subscription.** Upon subscribing to Premium features, you will receive a client certificate that uniquely identifies your licensed installation.

### 3.3 Premium Tier - Network Connections Required
**IMPORTANT: Premium Tier features require periodic network connections to Our license servers for the following purposes:**

a) **Initial Activation**: When first subscribing to Premium, the Software will connect to Our servers to:
   - Validate your enrollment token
   - Obtain your client certificate
   - Receive your initial license token

b) **License Renewal**: The Software will automatically connect to Our servers:
   - Approximately [7] days before your subscription expires
   - To verify your subscription payment status
   - To renew your license token if payment is current
   - At intervals during any grace period

c) **Certificate Operations**: The Software may connect to Our servers to:
   - Renew expiring certificates (approximately 30 days before expiration)
   - Check certificate revocation status
   - Validate license integrity

d) **License Migration**: When transferring your Premium license to a new device, the Software will connect to Our servers to:
   - Validate the migration request
   - Deactivate the license on the old device
   - Activate the license on the new device

### 3.4 Offline Operation (Premium Tier)
Premium Tier features are designed to operate offline for the duration of your active subscription period. However, periodic network connectivity is required for license renewal and certificate management. Extended offline use beyond your subscription expiration date will result in loss of Premium functionality (reverting to Free Tier).

### 3.5 Grace Period (Premium Tier)
If your subscription payment fails or expires, Premium features will continue to function for a limited grace period:
- **Monthly subscriptions**: [5] days
- **Annual subscriptions**: [14] days

During the grace period, the Software will attempt to connect to Our servers daily to check for subscription renewal. After the grace period expires without payment, Premium features will be disabled and Free Tier features will remain available.

### 3.6 Network Requirements (Premium Tier Only)
Premium Tier features require:
- HTTPS connectivity to [license-server.yourdomain.com] on ports 443 and 8443
- Ability to validate SSL/TLS certificates
- No proxy authentication (or proper proxy configuration)

### 3.7 Firewall Considerations (Premium Tier Only)
If you use Premium features with a firewall, you must allow outbound HTTPS connections to Our license servers. Blocking these connections will prevent Premium license validation and may result in loss of Premium functionality.
